  summary: A Python package for path sampling simulations

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    OpenPathSampling is a library for trajectory-based rare events
    simulations, including transition path sampling, transition interface
    sampling, and committor simulations. Note that for real-world usage, you
    must also install one of the powerful molecular dynamics engines that
    OPS interfaces with, such as OpenMM or Gromacs. If you install those
    seprately, OPS will automatically support your installation of them.
